## Current Development Status
- Character AI. Currently the non-player characters are only capable of swapping places with or following the player. This will be expanded to allow them to carry items and have unique abilities (e.g. faster sprint, larger carrying capacity etc.)
- Level Design. This will always be an ongoing process until the project is pretty much complete. I currently have 2 planet environments designed, both with unique atmosphere and style.
- Vehicle driving. While I have a functioning vehicle implemented, this is still somewhat basic and doesnt feature any advanced mechanics like suspension or wheelspin.

## Why?
This is a personal passion project that I started working on in my free time. I wanted to create something unique that adheres to my vision and my vision alone, whcih is why I decided against using assets from other sources.
